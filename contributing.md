# Contributing to Volunteer Manager

All are welcome and encouraged to contribute to Volunteer Manager. This project is coordinated by [Learn for Good](https://www.meetup.com/Learn-for-Good/), which coordinates work on the project and approves pull requests.

Before anyone can contribute, we need to establish:

* A place to find a list of open tasks
* A list of people to communicate with if you need help completing a task you've signed up for
* Documentation on how to fork a repository and issue a pull request back into the original 
* A working definition of "done"
